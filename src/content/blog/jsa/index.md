I’m currently contracting for Jobs and Skills Australia (JSA), which recently published its 2024 annual report 📊, highlighting some of the groundbreaking projects we’re working on. If you haven’t heard of JSA, it’s a dynamic Australian government taskforce 💪 dedicated to empowering workers and industries by creating opportunities and breaking down barriers 🚀.

One project I’m particularly passionate about is the development of a national skills taxonomy 🛠️. This initiative shifts the focus from job titles to the actual skills individuals bring to the table. It’s a game-changer for people like me—someone who transitioned from economics 📉 to data analytics 📈—showcasing how transferable skills can open new doors 🚪.

But JSA’s mission goes far beyond employment statistics. It’s about unlocking everyone’s potential 🌟, ensuring all Australians can fully leverage their capabilities in a rapidly evolving workforce 🌏.

If you’re curious about our work or want to explore the report, feel free to check it out or reach out—I’d love to share more! 💬
