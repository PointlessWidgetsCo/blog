The [**Internet Vacancy Index (IVI)**](https://www.jobsandskills.gov.au/data/internet-vacancy-index), a monthly data series measuring online job advertisements in Australia, is one of the many useful indicators published by Jobs and Skills Australia (JSA).

In February, online job advertisements fell 5.9% from January on a seasonally adjusted basis, marking a 15% decline from a year ago. This aligns with the broader trend of the unemployment rate gradually rising toward pre-pandemic levels. Despite this drop, JSA notes that job ads remain historically elevated.

To explore these trends, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard based on JSAâ€™s publicly available IVI dataset. This tool allows users to track historical trends and filter job advertisements by state, month, and occupation.

Below is an embeded Power BI dashboard:

For example, while overall job advertisements declined, the ICT sector saw mixed results. Job ads for ICT Professionals increased in February across most states, except for Tasmania and the Northern Territory.
- The strongest growth was for ICT Support and Test Engineers (+15.5%).
- In contrast, Multimedia Specialists and Web Developers experienced a 3.4% decline.
